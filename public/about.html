<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Adam, and I'm 15 years old. I’ve recently become really passionate
  about learning how to code. Every day, I spend hours diving into different
  programming languages, trying to understand how they work and what I can
  create with them. It’s incredible how coding allows you to build almost
  anything you can imagine, from apps to websites and beyond. My goal is to keep
  improving and mastering more complex coding techniques as I go along.

  In the future, I hope to work for big tech companies where I can contribute to
  exciting and innovative projects. I’m fascinated by the idea of using
  technology to solve real-world problems and make a difference. Right now, I’m
  focused on learning as much as I can, and I’m excited to see where this
  journey will take me. Working in the tech industry someday would be a dream
  come true, and I’m committed to making it happen.
